A small fan-website that makes me very nervous!

I made this site around when Instagram stopped letting you DM people without them accepting it. I noticed a lot of my mutuals were sad, since they'd DM idols for fun, not really intending for them to see it. Just to say some silly things, and in a few instances that I've seen, send pictures of their dogs! I was feeling rather ambitious, so I tried to make a Walmart Instagram clone. In essence, it allows you to DM Stray Kids and refresh to send the messages into the abyss, never to be seen again :'D
